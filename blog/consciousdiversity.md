An ideal day in my world incorporates physical challenge, intriguing thoughts, creative work, and engaging/meaningful conversations. I like to call this conscious diversity. 

Achieving this will be different for everyone. Iâ€™ll give an example for myself to see if that helps. 

Below you find a list of activities for each of these categories: 

### Physical Challenge 
A type of physical activity that gets your heart beat up to the point of exhaustion. This is possible in numerous ways. My favorite is running hills. 

Other examples of physical challenges
* High intensity work out
* Hiking 
* Suana
* Sports

### Intriguing thoughts
Genuine and curious thoughts that keep you motivated and excited. My favorite are philosophical and deep thinking questions like how we make decisions everyday. 

Other examples of stimulating intriguing thoughts
* Reflection cards
* Writing 
* Reading 
* Listening to music, podcast, story, or book

### Creative work
To be creative one must try to create. There are many different ways to build what you envision. Choose one and try to master it. 

Other examples of creative work
* Photography
* Drawing
* Woodworking
* Painting 
* Coding 
* Singing 
* Dancing

There are so many ways to create!!!

### Engaging/meaningful conversations
Life is better shared. Talk with your family, friends, and neighbors. Observe and listen. Apply what you see fits best for you. 

Other ways to have engaging/meaningful conversations
* Talk about your passions 
* Learn about family history with family members
* Ask your friends about how there lives are going 

This a lifestyle choice I have made for myself. You can decide what conscious diversity is for you and how it can benefit you.
