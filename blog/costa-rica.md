A jungle beach paradise located in Central America that contains an abundance of life, spirit, love, animals, fresh food, and any reason to continue to ask your self, “why don’t I stay?”. I landed in San Jose, spent a night and half a day exploring the city then headed to Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, known to locals as Puerto Viejo. A Caribbean coast town infused with African Jamaican culture. Downtown you have karaoke that goes to 3 in the morning and beaches that stretch for miles. I am living on a permaculture farm located about 4 miles outside of town. I quickly learned that Taxis were expensive and my walk to the closest grocery store was about 3.5 miles there and back. Internet was slow but worked just enough to get the job done. When I was not working, I walked through the property and watched the forest bloom overnight. Water on the property is rain collected and stored in tanks. I showered underneath the stars every night. Cabins and compost dry toilets with no doors gave you a view of spiders, monkeys, and capybaras. There are two other people living here in other cabins plus the hosts. I learn about ceremonies they are participating in. They call it medicine. They call it work. They call it life. I believe them.

I do find I am alone though as I strum my guitar singing to the birds. I wrote a song.

I have a vision for my home and sometimes it is difficult sticking up for my dreams when everyone around me thinks differently. I will keep my head high and continue to believe in my self.
