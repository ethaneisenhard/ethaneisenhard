A place of gracious hosts, warm weather, chaotic driving, spicy food, sweet sugary treats, spiritual wisdom, and a desire to grow. I landed in Bangalore where I spent three days exploring India for the first time in my life. My first meal was dosa a type of fried bread with potatoes and onions. Dosa is a common breakfast here in southern india. If you want eggs for breakfast they have bread wrapped in green pepper and onion omelets. I met Akhil’s friends and we learned what they like to do in the city. Working 10 hours ahead of EST was tough but I quickly adjusted.

We then went to Hyderabad, a ten hour drive from Bangalore. We invited our other college friend, Shreyash, and off we went north. Compared to Bangalore, the highways were newer due to a stronger economy. Tucked below the tech and corporate sky rises, the beautiful mess remained. Pick your choice of dirty food cart corners serving hot kebab and lentil rice. We celebrated a holiday and flew kites to celebrate. Feelings of reading the Kite Runner in 9th grade came flooding back in mind. We explored the old city of Hyderabad where sidewalks covered in trash and shopping carts overwhelm the center. We waited in a line and drank chai with the locals. Then it was time to head east to the village.

Akhil’s family has a farm and I have enjoyed learning more about the agriculture here in india. Palm oil trees create a wonderful canopy where cocoa leaves grow. In the fields, rows of dragon fruit wrapped themselves around concrete slabs where they will bloom in the summer. We ate a cocoa plant right from the tree and drank fresh coconuts.

For many people in India, it is the first time they are seeing a white person in real life. Naturally they are curious. Some even ask for pictures which I gladly accepted.

I find myself connected to the temples, praying for peace and love, plus learning what Hinduism means to the people of India.

Now we are preparing to leave the village back to Hyderabad before heading into the mountains. There we seek the great valley of Parvati. We are taking an overnight bus to Kullu, where we are staying two nights then heading into the higher regions.

The 22 hours train ride from Hyderabad to New Delhi was long, tough, and restless but I enjoyed the experience. Watch a video about it here!

With two quick days in Kullu, filled with delicious food and long hikes, getting used to the mountains air temperatures, we are on a bus to Jarri then a cab to Malana.

Malana has a beautiful valley and a sacred village untouchable to any outsiders. A man shared a story behind these rules. “A man fell in love with his woman in the mountains. They lived happily off the land and had a family. The husband began to feel his wife was committing adultery without any proof. The husband then sent his son to chop off the wife’s head. The son returned with her head and said, “why did you send me to chop off my mother heads?”, the father answered, “she had commit sin against him and the family, she was untouchable”, the son answered, “without proof, you are the sinner here”, then he chopped the fathers head off.

Now I think that’s more of a legendary tale but it’s fun to share these stories. Malana is now known for its Malana cream (hash). We spent the day hiking, hanging out with our hosts, and learning about hash culture.

Then we left for Tosh. A snow storm was coming in as we changed valleys and when we woke up in the morning the area was coated in white. We spent the two days by the fire, reading books, drinking tea, and enjoying the view. We laughed at our selves because we slept in dog hair blankets without heat on vacation.

Now we made our way to Gargi, the sun view valley. The sun shines most of the day here, breaking the mountains horizon at 8 and dropping around 4. We hiked 3000 feet with our 35 lb bags to our hostel. The experience and hard work are rewarded.

Now our trip is coming to an end in the mountains. We are relaxing by the river in Kasol and reflecting on the last two weeks!
I’m thankful for Akhil and his family, the state of India, the friends we made on our trip, and God for guiding us.
