If you ask any of my friends or family, they will tell you I love to start things. From writing a book, to hosting a podcast, to making hiking videos, to taking photos, to building a company, to traveling the country, to teaching web development, to learning the piano, to even starting a blog. Lets just say, I am a man who loves ideas but lacks the determination to focus on one thing. 

Some might say this is a flaw. That consistency is key to a "successful life". That my inability to pick a single source of truth will lead to a bunch of unfinished projects. 

Sometimes I feel like they are right. I often don't see the results I want because I spread myself to thin. How can I expect to get anything done if I put too much on plate in the first place? 

Sometimes I feel like they are wrong. I am fueled by cognitive diversity. Its boring to do the same thing day in and day out. I spend 6-8 hours a day coding during the week. When I get off work hours, do I really want to do more coding? Absolutely not. I want to go on a run, hang with friends, or watch a movie.

Still, there is this endless pressure to figure out the balance of how I am gonna create the life I want without sacrifices the comforts I already have. Somewhere along this journey, I convinced my self that there was an ending. That at some point I would be content. When in truth, the only ending I will have is death. And in 300 years after my passing almost no one an earth or any other planet will know of me. So why do I spend so much time trying to find an ending when the journey ends with a last breath. 

I used to live for the moment. Now I find my self reaching for monetary goals like they will solve all my creative problems.
