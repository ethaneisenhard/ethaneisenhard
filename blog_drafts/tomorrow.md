I am turning 25 in 48 days. For the first time in my life I am contemplating my existence. 

The truth is I don't feel like I am living up to my own potential. I have a dream of one day building my own self sustaining village. Right now, I am on the path of a mediocre life. I have everything my parents dreamed of and yet I do not feel alive. I am grateful for what I have been able to accomplished in these years, still, there feels like something is missing. Should life feel more like an adventure rather than a calculated plan? And who's to say you can't have both. But my point is, I don't feel complete. 

My goal is to change that. 

Over the next year, I plan on traveling the entire country of America in my Nissan Sentra. I have booked my stays all the way to June then I plan to go out west to see friends and family. I have always wanted to work from the road, hoping from state to state, and seeing what this beautiful country has to share. 

While this plan does feel like a step in the right direction, I still feel incomplete. Maybe because I have not left yet. Maybe because my bags are still half packed on my bedroom floor because right before I was set to leave something out of my control stopped me from going. Maybe because I want a different car to drive in order to do more camping style trips on the weekend. Maybe because I don't feel like I am moving fast enough. 

We all live like we are owed tomorrow. We plan our lives out like we are going to have this long beautiful arch of a story that will end by dying of old age. When the truth is, for many of us that will not happen. There are too many variables at play to predict the future. I invest in stocks and 401ks, but it feels like I never invest in my self. Not because I think its a good use of my money but because it will bring a smile to my face. 

"Take the leap". 

"Just do it". 

These are the words I tell myself but I never commit. Maybe thats why I don't feel alive. Because nothing is at stake. I am just another college grad who paid too much for education, who fears that any risk taken might  hurt my finances so much that I will never recover. Should that same fear drive me to make more money? Perhaps, but my comfortable lifestyle has made me unmotivated. I am motivated enough to write this blog because I have reached bottom. I am disgusted by my own lack of action to create my own business, to push my work out into the world and see what I can do.

So the question is, why am I writing this piece?

I am writing this piece because for the first time in my life I realize we are not owed tomorrow. There is no tomorrow. Because we cant do anything about tomorrow. We can plan for tomorrow. But once tomorrow comes it will be the present. The only thing we can do is live today.
