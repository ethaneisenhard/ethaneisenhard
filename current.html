        Around ever corner a new opporutntity awaits for you. However its how you seize opportunities that creates experience.
        This summer I interned at Surge Business Development, a small company focused on building local busniesses by building business model canvases
        and websites with search engine optimization. For my project I created a website for Andy Masullo, an athetlic trainer, who focuses on the mental
        side of sports. Throughout the summer we would meet and discuss how we could help his company grow. One of the first ideas we decided on was to
        build the company around his name. The thought was that this would allow him to stand out against the rest of the competition because his name is unique.
        Second idea was to build a website that helps build his credibitly and brings the user in. Together these two ideas would act as the pillars to hold up
        his company. As the summer comes to an end, it helps to refelct on these desicions. I think that as Andy moves foward with his comany it will help to build
        a name for himself. Additionally, with the imporatnce of having an online presence, his website will allow him to relevant. For me, the oppotunity to build
        website for a client has helped me build my portfolio. I want to use this oppoutnity to launch my career as a front-end developer. There is no price you can
        put on experience and having this opporutinty will help build my professional career.
